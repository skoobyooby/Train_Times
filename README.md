# Train_Times

Train Times is a web app that provides real time train arrival times for users. 
Users can add a new train by filling at a form that includes the train name, 
the first train of the day's departure time, and the frequency at which the train
stops at the same stop. 

Using Moment.js, Train Times calculates the next possible train arrival and returns the
time until the next train (minutes) as well as its scheduled time. Train input is stored
using Google Firebase.

Get started by entering your train name, the interval between its arrival times (frequency), and the first
time of the day that it stops at your station.
